Usage:

[Module] net.twitter

[Class] <twitter-cred>

  An object holding necessary information to access to the user's Twitter
  account.  It has the following instance slots.

   consumer-key
   consumer-secret
   access-token
   access-token-secret


[Function] twitter-authenticate-client consumer-key consumer-secret
                                       :optional input-callback

  Authenticate the client using twitter's PIN-based OAuth authentication
  flow.  First it obtains request-token, then ask the user to access
  a specific URL to grant access by the client.  Once the user grant access,
  Twitter presents a PIN to the user, which should be fed back
  to the procedure to obtain access token and secret.

  Once this process completes, the client program can store the access
  token and access token secret to access the user's Twitter account,
  until the user explicitly asks to discard those credentials.  So, 
  in general, this procedure needs to be called once per user per client.

  The INPUT-CALLBACK is a procedure that handles user intervention.
  It is called by one argument, the Twitter URL the user should access.
  By default it prints the URL and asks the user to go there and obtain
  PIN, and prompts the user to enter it.  It should return the entered
  PIN in string, or #f to indicate the user aborted the process.
  If the callback returns an empty string, it is called again.

  Twitter-authenticate-client returns an instance of <twitter-cred>.


[Function] twitter-post message cred

  Post a MESSAGE.  CRED is an instance of <twitter-cred>.
