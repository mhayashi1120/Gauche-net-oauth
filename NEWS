* 2010-06-23  Release 1.2

Made twitter-followers/ids use the follower/ids.xml REST API instead
of statues/follower.xml, and handle pagenations automatically; that is,
twitter-followers/ids always returns complete list of followers.


* 2010-06-10  Release 1.1

Fixed oauth-nonce that could return the same nonce.
